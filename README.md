About
-------------------

Real Time systems are one of the most used system. Any industry where some form of automation is present, most probably uses Real Time systems
The tasks need to be scheduled such that theu dont miss any deadlines.
There are many types of scheduling algorithms - RMA and EDF being the most popular

Scheduability Analysis
-----------------------

If a given task set can be scheduled by an algorithm without missing any deadline then it is said to be scheduable.
The given code is the implementation of a scheduablity test for a task set under RMA algorithm.
